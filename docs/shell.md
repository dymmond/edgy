# Shell Support

Who never needed to load a few database models ina command line  or have the need to do it so and
got stuck trying to do it and wasted a lot of time?

Well, Edgy gives you that possibility completely out of the box and ready to use with your
application models.

!!! Warning
    Be aware of the use of this special class in production! It is advised not to use it there.

## Important

Before reading this section, you should get familiar with the ways Edgy handles the discovery
of the applications.

The following examples and explanations will be using the [auto discovery](./migrations/discovery.md#auto-discovery)
but [--app and environment variables](./migrations/discovery.md#environment-variables) approach but the
is equally valid and works in the same way.

!!! Tip
    See the [extras](./extras.md) section after getting familiar with the previous. There offers
    a way of using the shell without going through the **Migrate** object.

## How does it work

Edgy ecosystem is complex internally but simpler to the user. Edgy will use the application
using the [migration](./migrations/migrations.md#migration) and automatically extract the
[registry](./registry.md) from it.

From there it will automatically load the [models](./models.md) and [reflected models](./reflection/reflection.md)
into the interactive python shell and load them for you with ease ðŸŽ‰.

### Requirements

To run any of the available shells you will need `ipython` or `ptpython` or both installed.

**IPython**

```shell
$ pip install ipython
```

or

```shell
$ pip install edgy[ipython]
```

**PTPython**

```shell
$ pip install ptpython
```

or

```shell
$ pip install edgy[ptpyton]
```

### How to call it

#### With [auto discovery](./migrations/discovery.md#auto-discovery)

**Default shell**

```shell
$ edgy shell
```

**PTPython shell**

```shell
$ edgy shell --kernel ptpython
```

#### With [--app and environment variables](./migrations/discovery.md#environment-variables)

**--app**

```shell
$ edgy --app myproject.main:app shell
```

**Environment variables**

```shell
$ export EDGY_DEFAULT_APP=--app myproject.main:app
$ edgy shell --kernel ptpython
```

### How does it look like

Edgy doesn't want to load all python globals and locals for you. Instead loads all the
essentials for the models and reflected models and some python packages.

It looks like this:

Of course the `EDGY-VERSION` and `APPLICATION` are replaced automatically by the version you are
using.

#### Example

Let us see an example using example using Esmerald and we will have:

* Three [models](./models.md):
    * User - From an [esmerald application][esmerald_application] `accounts`.
    * Customer - From an [esmerald application][esmerald_application] `customers`.
    * Product - From an [esmerald application][esmerald_application] `products`.
* Two [reflected models](./reflection/reflection.md):
    * Payment - From a payments table reflected from the existing database.
    * RecordView - From a SQL View reflected from the existing database.

And it will look like this:

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tarsild/image/upload/v1691427229/packages/edgy/resources/reflected_cdc3rg.png" alt='Shell Example'>

Pretty cool, right? Then it is a normal python shell where you can import whatever you want and
need as per normal python shell interaction.
