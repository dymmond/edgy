### Added

- allow multiple ForeignKeys with the same related_name in one model

- Breaking: Prefetch traversal of foreign keys uses now the foreign key name. For the traversal of RelatedFields everything stays the same.
- ForeignKeys use now global constraints
- pk is now a CompositeField (work for multiple primary keys in one model is on the way)
- ConditionalRedirect constant for CompositeField

## 0.11.1

### Added

- [create_schema](./tenancy/edgy.md#the-schema-creation) allowing a dynamic and programatically
way of creating schemas in the database.

### Changed

- Updated `reflection` from `edgy.ReflectModel` to use the internal database session and avoid
deadlocks.

## 0.9.2

### Changed

- Update internal anyio dependency.

## 0.9.1

### Changed

- Upgrade internal requirements.

### Fixed

- `auto_now` and `auto_now_add` on `save()` and `update()` wasn't only updating the

- Object discovery for intellisense in any IDE.

## 0.8.1

### Added

- Added new experimental [activate_schema](./tenancy/edgy.md#using-with-activate_schema) for tenant models using the `using` queryset operator.

to the right tenant.

## 0.8.0

### Added

Flask, bottle or any other by using the newly added [run_sync](./queries/queries.md#blocking-queries). [#60](https://github.com/dymmond/edgy/pull/60).

### Fixed

- Fixed multi tenancy from contrib. [#58](https://github.com/dymmond/edgy/pull/58).
- Fixed `using` where schema name was raising a not found reference for foreign key
when querying the tenant. [#58](https://github.com/dymmond/edgy/pull/58).
- Fixed `exclude_secrets` when querying models with foreign keys. [#59](https://github.com/dymmond/edgy/pull/59).

filtering the query.

### Changed

- Updated internal support for `databasez` 0.7.0 and this fixes the URL parsing errors for complex passwords
caused by the `urlsplit`.

## 0.6.0

### Changed

- `inspectdb` is now handled by an independent isolated called `InspectDB`.

### Fixed

- `server_default` does not raise a `FieldValidationError`.
- `server_default` added as validation for nullable.
- `null` was not being applied properly from the newly added `server_default`.

!!! Warning
	This could impact your migrations, so the advise would be to generate a new migration
	after upgrading to the new version of Edgy to make sure the database reflects the proper
	nullables/non-nullable fields.

### Key features

* **Model inheritance** - For those cases where you don't want to repeat yourself while maintaining
integrity of the models.
* **Abstract classes** - That's right! Sometimes you simply want a model that holds common fields
that doesn't need to created as a table in the database.
* **Meta classes** - If you are familiar with Django, this is not new to you and Edgy offers this
in the same fashion.
* **Managers** - Versatility at its core, you can have separate managers for your models to optimise
specific queries and querysets at ease.
* **Filters** - Filter by any field you want and need.
* **Model operators** - Classic operations such as `update`, `get`, `get_or_none`, `bulk_create`,
`bulk_update`, `values`, `values_list`, `only`, `defer` and a lot more.
* **Relationships made it easy** - Support for `OneToOne`, `ForeignKey` and `ManyToMany` in the same Django style.
* **Constraints** - Unique constraints through meta fields.
* **Indexes** - Unique indexes through meta fields.
* **Native test client** - We all know how hard it can be to setup that client for those tests you
need so we give you already one.
