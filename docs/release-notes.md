# Release Notes

## 0.35.5

### Fixed

- Fixed collapsing of uniques when `Q` is provided.

## 0.35.4

### Added

- Support for `queryset_class` in the managers. This allows to override the default `Queryset` with a custom one.
This is useful when we need to have nested querysets that relies on an initial manager to be custom.

#### Example

```python
from edgy import Manager, QuerySet

class CustomQuerySet(QuerySet):

  def filter(...):
    ...


class CustomManager(Manager):
  queryset_class = CustomQuerySet
```

## 0.35.3

### Added

- Full support for `Q` filtering across **ManyToMany** relationships, including deeply nested lookups such as
  `Q(products__role__name__icontains="shelf")`.
- Automatic join‑promotion for M2M paths when using `Q` boolean expressions (`&`, `|`, `~`).
- Support for combining `Q` objects with global OR (`or_`) and local OR (`local_or`), including mixed clause trees.
- Expanded clause normalisation ensuring nested Q trees correctly propagate join metadata.

### Changed

- Improved relationship traversal inside `crawl_relationship` to properly detect ManyToMany paths and promote them into `tables_and_models`.
- Enhanced clause builder to unify M2M join handling across Q, `and_`, `or_`, and normal keyword filters.
- Upgraded join inference so nested Q expressions behave as a single logical unit with consistent table resolution.

### Fixed

- Fixed `KeyError` on ManyToMany lookups such as `products__name__icontains` and
  `products__role__name__icontains`.
- Resolved issues where nested Q groups (`Q(Q(...))`) failed to carry select_related metadata.
- Corrected boolean combination evaluation where M2M joins were lost during normalization.

## 0.35.2

### Added

- Introduced improved global OR and local OR logic for QuerySet filtering.
- Enhanced clarity and examples in the documentation for `or_` and `local_or` operators.
- Introduced pipe-style boolean filtering using `Q` objects (e.g. `Q(name="Adam") | Q(email__icontains="edgy")`).
- Added support for nested `Q(Q(...))` expressions with automatic flattening.
- Improved handling of relational lookups within nested clause trees.
- New [Q Operator](./queries/q.md) documentation section.

### Changed

- Updated query-building internals to properly promote filters during global OR operations.
- Refined internal clause normalization to ensure `Q`, `and_`, and `or_` behave consistently across nested structures.
- Improved propagation of `select_related` hints from nested Q expressions.

### Fixed

- Correct handling of OR clauses when mixing global and local modes.
- Fixed edge cases where nested Q expressions involving related fields (`user__email`, `product__id`, etc.) did not correctly promote join metadata.
- Corrected boolean combination behavior when mixing `Q`, `or_`, and `local_or` in the same query chain.

## 0.35.1

### Fixed

- Issue with classvars in python 3.14.

## 0.35.0

### Added

- New [select_for_update()](./queries/queries.md#select-for-update) operator allowing to lock rows and avoid race conditions.
- New [CombinedQueryset](./queries/combined-queries.md) operators (Union, Inteserct).
- Support for Python 3.14

### Changed

- Remove `loguru` dependency.
- Reorganise some internals for better clarity and separation of concerns.

### Fixed

- Fix `auto_create_schema` and `auto_drop_schema` of `TenantMixin` which were not used at all.
- Fix m2m returning through model when using create.
- Fix incorrect use of delete and save in relations. They should use the raw versions as they are not userfacing.

### Removed

- `handle_annotations` as it no longer serves its purpose.

## 0.34.1

### Added

- [add_many()](./queries/many-to-many.md#add_many) to ManyToManyField for adding multiple relations at once.
- [remove_many()](./queries/many-to-many.md#remove_many) to ManyToManyField for removing multiple relations at once.
- Add `arefresh_metadata` which doesn't use sometimes a second loop but is async from the start.

### Changed

- Don't autoimport models which are excluded from admin.
- Deprecate `edgy.settings`, code should use `edgy.monkay.settings` instead. This is for Edgy internals, the end user can still
use `from edgy.conf import settings`.

### Fixed

- Lifespan eventloop was not the same as the eventloop in shell (ipython, ptpython).
- Improve automatic imports.
- Unnecessary database initializations during `create_all`.
- Fix `__module__` attribute for autogenerated through models.
- Fix tenant models not included in migrations.
- Proper handle `db_schema` in `refresh_metadata`.

## 0.34.0

### Changed

- For `ManyToManyField` make `NEW_M2M_NAMING` the default. No need to set it explicit anymore.
- Use `sayer` for cli.
- Add .jinja suffix to admin templates (makes it easier to recognize jinja templates for IDEs and humans).
- Move `404.html.jinja` to admin, as it is solely used by `admin_serve` now.
- `schemas`: Use for non-schema databases (include now fallbacks). This simplifies the codebase.

### Fixed

- The `create_admin_app` created lilya instance doesn't intercept 404 errors anymore.
- `404.html.jinja` uses now also the `base_definitions.html.jinja` so we can exchange libraries at one place.
- `schemas`: Misc fixes. We could end up with a wrong context or a closed database.

### Removed

- The deprecated `activate_schema_path` method.

### Warning

- The omitting of `through_tablename=edgy.NEW_M2M_NAMING` for `ManyToManyField` only **works** for edgy `>=0.34.0`.
  To stay backward compatible you still have to pass the arguments.

## 0.33.3

### Fixed

- Handling non-starlette like lifespan when executing shell.

### Changed

- Replace ASGIHelper by monkay asgi helpers.
- Replace generate_asgi_events by monkay asgi helpers.

## 0.33.2

### Fixed

- Rollback from a regression in the `core.terminal` colors causing issues with the shell

## 0.33.1

### Fixed

- Crash because pydantic requires email-validator.
- Incorrectly assigned table Alias to .table of model instances.

## 0.33.0

### Added

- Allow multiple admins.
- Add asgi multiplexing middleware (`edgy.contrib.lilya.middleware.EdgyMiddleware`).
- Support for `isnull` operator for querysets on a field.
- Support for `isempty` operator for querysets on a field.
- Support `NumberedPaginator` as alias for `Paginator` (n fact `Paginator` is an alias of `NumberedPaginator`).

## Changed

- `JSONField` uses now `JSONB` by default for postgresql (and only for postgresql).
- Slightly changed `InspectDB` internal interface.
- When using a relation, all queryset operations are by default executed on the target model except for ManyToManyFields with `embed_through=""` (default).
  In this case the reference is the through model. E.g.
  ``` python
  class User(edgy.Model):
    name = edgy.CharField(max_length=255)
      ...
  class Product(edgy.Model):
      name = edgy.CharField(max_length=255)
      users = edgy.ManyToMany("User", related_name="products", through_tablename=edgy.NEW_M2M_NAMING)
      users2 = edgy.ManyToMany("User", embed_through="", related_name="products", through_tablename=edgy.NEW_M2M_NAMING)
      users3 = edgy.ManyToMany("User", embed_through="embedded", related_name="products", through_tablename=edgy.NEW_M2M_NAMING)

  product: Product = ...
  await product.users.order_by("name")
  # use old way
  await product.users2.order_by("user__name")
  # sort for product name
  await product.users3.order_by("embedded__product__name")
  ```

### Fixed

- Status code when page in admin was not found.
- Fix issues with json-editor ajax and enums by simply inlining all schemas and disabling ajax.
- For the json schema view: don't use ref_template, it isn't well supported and leads to problems with enums.
- Fix crash when `None` is passed to CompositeField.
- Fix values_list when using relation queryset.
- Fix values_list when using only string.
- Fix performance when using relation queryset.
- Fix order_by when using relation queryset.
- Fix crash when `None`is passed to `IPAddressField`.

### Breaking

- `JSONField` uses now postgresql `JSONB` by default for postgresql (and only for postgresql).
  This may can cause an extra migration (because variants are used). If this is unwanted,
  add: `no_jsonb=True` to `JSONField`.
- By fixing the column retrieval of order_by, ... we may break userspace. Fix it by removing the now superfluous prefix. `embed_through=""` is not affected as we have here the old interface.

## 0.32.5

### Fixed

- Admin with foreign keys as primary keys.
- Revisioning with `auto_now` as primary key.
- Fix crash with `auto_now_add` as primary key.
- Fix "$defs" not matching def names. This fixes problems with enums which appear multiple times and reduces requests.
- Fix using ForeignKeys in embedded models/CompositeFields when the embedded model has no registry set (e.g. abstract).
- Improve admin UI.
- Add some extra filters and option to make Primarykeys read-only in marshall.

### Changed

- Remove by default read-only fields from admin create/update.
- Remove by default autoincrement fields from admin create.
- Make PrimaryKeys read-only for update (they will be removed because they are read-only until we have a better solution).
- `FileStruct` name have a minimal length of 1.

## 0.32.4

### Fixed

- Fix incorrect documentation for admin.
- Fix admin_serve behind a reverse proxy.

## 0.32.3

### Fixed

- Add proper error for python>=3.12, when marshall_config is added as instance annotation.

## 0.32.2

### Added

- Add model search in admin.

### Changed

- Split out base head from admin into an extra template. This improves the customizability and allows to self-host.

### Fixed

- Circular import errors with marshalls.
- Missing typing export for PGArrayField.
- Proper escape json values.

## 0.32.1

### Added

- Customization hooks for admin.
- Expose marshalls in a global `edgy.marshalls` namespace.
- Add authentication for `admin_serve`.

### Changed

- Don't import mixins from sub-modules in `edgy.core.db.models.mixins` (to prevent import-cycles).
- Move Metaclass from `BaseMarshall` to `Marshall`.
- `admin_prefix_url` is automatically inferred.
- Require `session` for embedding admin.

### Fixed

- Allow marshalls with the name `Marshall`.
- Fix repr on marshalls.
- Fix recent_models.

## 0.32.0

### Added

- Allow partial Marshalls.
- Add admin_serve for modifying db.
- FileFields have now a json-schema mode. You can pass a FileStruct like dict.

### Changed

- `_loaded_or_deleted` is now `_db_loaded_or_deleted`. The former name is now deprecated.
- `_loaded_or_deleted` is splitted in `_db_loaded` and `_db_deleted`.
- Migrations show now tracebacks when manual migration of objects fails.
- Bump python requirement to python 3.10 to align with (optional) dependencies.

### Fixed

- Recursive saving.
- Various json schema fixes.
- Inherit register_default.

### Breaking

- Python 3.9 is no longer supported.
- Remove long-deprecated `edgy_setattr` alias for `object.__setattr__`.

## 0.31.3

### Fixed

- Loose minimum version of rich causing conflicts.

## 0.31.2

### Added

- Add the method `get_server_default`.
- Add `get_columns_nullable`, `get_server_default` and `customize_default_for_server_default` to factory
  overwritable methods.

### Changed

- `server_default` is not extracted anymore by `ColumnDefinitionModel`. Use `get_server_default` instead.
- Lazy evaluate the environment variable for the settings import. This relaxes the restraints on the import order.
  You can e.g. import edgy settings before adjusting `EDGY_SETTINGS_MODULE` as long as you don't access the settings object.
- Don't call `evaluate_settings_once_ready` during init of Registry anymore.


### Removed

- Remove the abstract method `customize_default_for_server_default` from BaseFieldType.

### Fixed

- Fix potential too early import of settings because of the auto computation of server_defaults.

### Breaking

When creating a custom field providing get_columns and
relying on the extraction of server defaults from field, you may need to update the code to use `get_server_default`.

## 0.31.1

### Fixed

- Fix and test QuerySet caching.
- Fix potential hang in `get_metadata_of_all_schemes` with `force_rollback` active.

## 0.31.0

### Added

- Add the ChoiceField alternative CharChoiceField.
- `model_instance` parameter for *_save, *_update signals.

### Changed

- Cleanup the callback interface:
  - The instances are only passed via ContextVars.
  - `force_insert` is by `is_update` replaced.
  - Delete uses now *_INSTANCE ContextVars.
- Split `delete` in `delete` (only used for direct calls) and `raw_delete` for better customizations.
- Split `save` in `save` (only used for direct calls) and `real_save` for better customizations.
- Remove internal only parameter `remove_referenced_call` from delete (but not from raw_delete).
- Change the `remove_referenced_call` to also accept strings, which are the fields from which the deletion originates from.
- Virtual cascade and model based deletions doesn't trigger delete signals anymore (except if `__deletion_with_signals__=True` is set).
- `QuerySet.create` passes now the QuerySet instance as `CURRENT_INSTANCE`.
- `QuerySet.create` passes now the QuerySet instance as signal parameter instance.

### Fixed

- `QuerySet.create` passed the model instance as `CURRENT_INSTANCE`.
- Virtual cascade and model based deletions doesn't trigger delete signals anymore.
- Fix spurious iterate bug in `bulk_get_or_create`, triggered in `edgy-guardian`.
- Fix wrong signal sender class for proxy models.

### Breaking

- For authors of custom fields: the interface of the async callback hooks changed:
  - The instances are only passed via ContextVars.
  - `force_insert` is by `is_update` replaced.
  - Delete callbacks use now *_INSTANCE ContextVars.
- When you overwrote the `delete` method of a model, you probably want to overwrite now `raw_delete`.
- When you overwrote the `save` method of a model, you probably want to overwrite now `real_save`.
- `delete` losses its internal only parameter `remove_referenced_call`.
- When using the pre_save/post_save signal, you might want to use the `model_instance` parameter instead of the `instance`
  parameter. We pass down `QuerySet`s now in create.

## 0.30.1

### Changed

- Split from Page and Paginator BasePaginator and BasePage.
- Add fields next_page, previous_page, current_page to Page.
- Add field current_cursor to CursorPage.
- Make specifying all of the page attributes mandatory.

### Fixed

- Fix and improve pagination examples.

## 0.30.0

### Added

- Add optimized pagination for `QuerySet`.

### Changed

- Internal cleanup how the current row is passed in QuerySet.
- Optimize `reverse` method of QuerySet. Now it reuses a potential available cache.
- `build_pknames` and `build_pkcolumns` return their result instead of setting it automatically.
- Introduce `_edgy_namespace` for edgy related attributes.
- Use `_edgy_namespace` for managers.

### Fixed

- FieldFile did use potential heavily blocking sync API in async code paths.
- `reverse` when no order_by was set.
- Serialization fixes for newer pydantic versions (>=2.11).
- Private attributes handling.

## 0.29.0

### Added

- Convert for most fields defaults to server_default to ease migrations. There are some exceptions.
- Add the setting `allow_auto_compute_server_defaults` which allows to disable the automatic generation of server defaults.
- `pre_migrate` and `post_migrate` signals.

### Changed

- `get_default_value` is now also overwritable by factories.
- The undocumented default of `BooleanField` of `False` is removed.
- The signal receiver functions receive more parameters.

### Fixed

- JSONField `default` is deepcopied to prevent accidental modifications of the default.
  There is no need anymore to provide a lambda.
- `pre_update` and `post_update` is not called anymore when calling save and the update path is executed.
- `apply_default_force_nullable_fields` could run into transaction problems.
- `bulk_update` and `bulk_create` optimizations and small fixes.
- `pre_update` and `post_update` are now received when using a QuerySet.
- Allow prefixing column names in CompositeField via `prefix_column_name` parameter.

### Breaking

- The undocumented default of `BooleanField` of `False` is removed.
- Fields compute now `server_default`s for a set default. This can be turned off via the `allow_auto_compute_server_defaults` setting.


## 0.28.2

### Fixed

- Missing `message` parameter passing in migrate command after refactory.

## 0.28.1

### Changed

- `hash_names` has now two prefix parameters: `inner_prefix`, `outer_prefix`.

### Fixed

- `hash_names` with unique_together incorrectly fed the `uc` prefix into the hasher. This makes the names unidentificatable.
- `BooleanField` logic for automic migrations works by using server_default.

## 0.28.0

### Added

- `null-field` or `nf` parameter for makemigrations/revision.
- Add `FORCE_FIELDS_NULLABLE` ContextVar.
- Add `CURRENT_FIELD_CONTEXT` ContextVar.
- Add automigrations (migrations capsuled in Registry).

### Changed

- The default migration templates allow now to use complex defaults for migrations.
- Fields must use get_columns_nullable instead of ColumnDefinitionModel null. for determining if the columns should be nullable.
- For model `save` and `update` the values can be callables which are evaluated.
- Streamline ContentTypeField in using a parameter-less default function. Use `CURRENT_FIELD_CONTEXT` ContextVar field for referencing the owner.
- Fail when specifying a server_default for ForeignKey, ManyToMany, FileField, ImageField. This is not possible.
- Internals: _insert and _update have now a different signature.

### Fixed

- ForeignKeys aren't required to be saved models when passed.
- Cli command revision takes now also the arg argument.
- Revisioning works now with relative revisions with - (e.g. -2).
- Downgrades are now possible with unique_together. Build a constraint name from the fields.
- `is_partial` was incorrectly set to always `False` for the model.save update path.
- FileFields could have make problems when migrating.
- Differing ruff versions and rules between `hatch fmt` and `pre-commit`.

## 0.27.4

### Changed

- Use `orjson` instead of json for [bulk_get_or_create](./queries/queries.md#bulk-get-or-create).

## 0.27.3

### Added

- [bulk_get_or_create](./queries/queries.md#bulk-get-or-create) to queryset allowing to bulk inserting or getting existing objects.

### Fixed

- BooleanField typing. Thanks to Izcarmt95.

## 0.27.2

### Changed

- Edgy now allows inheritance of `unique_together` and `indexes` from abstract classes.

### Fixed

- Typo in `BaseContentTypeField` from `BaseContentTypeFieldField`.

## 0.27.1

### Added

- `SubFactory` in the model factory helpers allowing to import ModelFactory objects from
  other parts of the codebase and apply them directly as dependencies.
- New `template` to `edgy init` migrations for [sequencial](./migrations/migrations.md#templates) migration file names.
- Sequences like calls for ModelFactory.
- `context` as new parameter to the Marshalls.

### Changed

- The faker argument was switched out to `context`. The `context` parameter however behaves like a faker instance.

### Fixed

- `exclude_autoincrement` argument applies now also for the sub-factories. Previously we would have need to provide the parameters.

## 0.27.0

### Changed

- Added a new table naming schema for through models of ManyToMany fields. This requires however setting
  an explicit table naming schema via the `through_tablename` parameter.
- When `through_tablename` is a string, it is formatted with the field injected as field in the context.

### Fixed

- Multiple ManyFields from the same model to the same target model. Note: this is unrelated to `related_name`, setting the
  the `related_name` would not help.

### BREAKING

For now ManyToMany fields **must** explicitly have a `through_tablename` parameter in which
the table naming schema for the through model is selected.
For existing ManyToMany fields you should pass `edgy.OLD_M2M_NAMING"` so migrations doesn't drop the tables,
for new ManyToMany fields `edgy.NEW_M2M_NAMING"` which prevents clashes of through model names.
You may can also rename the through model table via migration and use the `edgy.NEW_M2M_NAMING"`
or simply use a non-empty string for the `through_tablename` parameter.

## 0.26.1

### Added

- Add PGArrayField.
- Add `build_and_save(...)` build variant to ModelFactory.
- Add `build(save=True)` to ModelFactory.

### Changed

- Reorganize fields. Make more lazy.
- Make models, querysets imports in `__init__.py` lazy so circular dependency errors arise no more.
- Change in ModelFactory the default of `exclude_autoincrement` from `False` to `True`.
  There is a strong demand in having save ready models.

## 0.26.0

### Added

- `__drop_extra_kwargs__` parameter for Models which drops extra kwargs instead passing down. Required for mashalling StrictModel.
- `reference_select` parameter in QuerySet.
- `extra_select` parameter in QuerySet for creating extra select clauses which can be referenced.
- `ref_foreign_key_fields` in meta.

### Changed

- Model allows now like ReflectModel arbitary arguments. Required for `reference_select`.
- Use a partly copied model as ProxyModel. This ensures that the logic of ReflectField still works.

### Fixed

- Cleanup of event-loops and threads in run_sync.
- Fix running shell with auto reflected models.
- Fix `DatabaseNotConnectedWarning` in shell.
- Usage of StrictModels in Mashalls.
- Different autoincrement field in Marshalls than `id`.
- Fix Marshall required check.
- Fix ReflectModel with exclude_secrets.
- Fix non-edgy-fields were stripped instead kept.
- Allow ComputedFields being part of a serialization.

## 0.25.1

### Added

- Add `exclude_autoincrement` parameter/class attribute to ModelFactory.
- Add `build_values` method to ModelFactory. It can be used to extract the values without a model.
- Make Registry initialization compatible with sync contexts via `with_async_env(loop=None)` method.
- `run_sync` has now an optional loop parameter.

### Changed

- The Relation mappings doesn't set the autoincrement id anymore.
- Relationship fields of auto generated ModelFactories of ForeignKey, ... are now excluded when not parametrized.
  This way large trees are avoided.
- Reduce the amount of generated related models to max 10 by default.
- Make `to_factory_field` and `to_list_factory_field` a method instead a classmethod.
  Otherwise they are quite limited.
- `to_list_factory_field` honors the min and max parameter specified by parameters.
  It defaults however to the provided min and max parameters.
- RefForeignKey has now an extra subclass of BaseField. This way the exclusion of works reliable.
- `run_sync` reuses idling loops.
- `run_sync` uses the loop set by the Registry contextmanager `with_async_env`.

### Fixed

- ModelFactory was prone to run in infinite recursions.
- The RefForeignKey field was not working correctly.


## 0.25.0

### Added

- Add `testing.factory.ModelFactory`.
- ManyToManyField `create_through_model` method allows now the keyword only argument `replace_related_field`.
- `add_to_registry` and models have now an additional keyword-only argument `on_conflict` for controlling what happens when a same named model already exists.
  For models this can be passed : `class Foo(edgy.Model, on_conflict="keep"): ...`.
- Passing a tuple or list of types to `replace_related_field` is now allowed.
- Add `through_registry` to ManyToMany.
- Add `no_copy` to models MetaInfo.
- Add `ModelCollisionError` exception.
- Add keyword only hook function `real_add_to_registry`. It can be used to customize the `add_to_registry` behaviour.
- Add `__no_load_trigger_attrs__` to edgy base model to prevent some attrs from causing a deferred load.

### Changed

- `create_edgy_model` has now `__type_kwargs__` which contains a dict of keyword arguments provided to `__new__` of type.
- RelatedField uses now `no_copy`.
- `add_to_registry` returns the type which was actually added to registry instead of None.
- Through models use now `no_copy` when autogenerated. This way they don't land in copied registries but are autogenerated again.
- Instead of silent replacing models with the same `__name__` now an error is raised.
- `skip_registry` has now also an allowed literal value: `"allow_search"`. It enables the search of the registry but doesn't register the model.
- Move `testclient` to `testing` but keep a forward reference.
- Change the default for ManyToMany `embed_through` from "" to `False` which affected traversing ManyToMany.
- Better protect secrets from leaking. Prevent load when accessing a secret field or column.

### Fixed

- Copying registries and models is working now.
- Fix deleting (clearing cache) of BaseForeignKey target.
- Creating two models with the same name did lead to silent replacements.
- Invalidating caused schema errors.
- ManyToMany and ForeignKey fields didn't worked when referencing tenant models.
- ManyToMany fields didn't worked when specified on tenant models.
- Fix transaction method to work on instance and class.
- Fix missing file conversion in File. Move from ContentFile.
- Fix mypy crashing after the cache was build (cause ChoiceField annotation).
- Fix handling unknown fields via the generic_field.
- Sanify default for embed_through which affected traversing ManyToMany.
  It defaulted to the backward compatible "" which requires the user to traverse the m2m model first.
- Prevent fully initialized models from triggering a deferred load.
- Prevent accessing excluded secrets from triggering a deferred load.

### BREAKING

- Instead of silent replacing models with the same `__name__` now an error is raised.
- The return value of `add_to_registry` changed. If you customize the function you need to return now the actual model added to the registry.
- The default for ManyToMany `embed_through` changed from "" to `False` which affected traversing ManyToMany. For keeping the old behaviour pass:
  `embed_through=""`.
- Accessing field values excluded by exclude_secrets doesn't trigger an implicit load anymore.

## 0.24.2

### Fixed

- Try harder to avoid circular imports when providing settings with edgy references.

## 0.24.1

### Fixed

- Comparation of a model with non-models.

## 0.24.0

### Added

- True multi-database migrations.
  You may need to rework your migrations in case you want to use it.
- Generalized `hash_to_identifier` function.
- `get_name` function on `metadata_by_url` dict.
- Differing databases can be passed via `database` attribute on models.
- `create` method on relations (reverse side of ForeignKeys and both sides of ManyToMany).

### Changed

- Breaking: empty names are not allowed anymore for extra. This includes names consisting of spaces.

### Fixed

- ForeignKey remote check failed for objects with different database but same registry.

## 0.23.3

### Fixed

- Version number mismatch.

## 0.23.1 & 0.23.2

### Fixed

- Docs were broken.
- Autodetection of the instance was broken when a directory containing dots is in the folder.
- Fix compatibility with pydantic 2.10.

## 0.23.0

### Added

- Extension support via Monkay.

### Changed

- Rework edgy to use Monkay.
- Imports are now lazy.
- Rework the migrate and shell system to simply use Monkay instance.
- Replace `get_registry_copy` by `get_migration_prepared_registry`.
- Breaking: migration configuration takes place in settings.
- Breaking: EdgyExtra and Migrate are replaced by `edgy.Instance` but are still available.
- Breaking: EdgyExtra is provided by the also obsolete Migrate.
- Breaking: `model_apps` is replaced by `preloads` but still available during the migration time.
- Breaking:
  An automatic registration is assumed. See [Connection](connection.md) for examples.
- Breaking: `--app` or `EDGY_DEFAULT_APP` must point to a module which does the self-registration not an app instance anymore.
- Deprecate `edgy.conf.enums.EnvironmentType`. Esmeralds `EnvironmentType` or an own definition should be used instead.
- Deprecate `edgy.conf.module_import.import_string`. Use `monkay.load` instead.

### Fixed

- Migrations with ManyToMany fields are broken.
- `get_engine_url_and_metadata` was broken for some operations (thanks @kokoserver).
- IPAddressField was not exposed as edgy.IPAddressField.

### Removed

- `edgy.conf.functional`. It was only used for configuration and is now superseeded by Monkay.

### Contributors

Thanks a lot to @kokoserver. He provided a *lot* of valuable bug reports and PRs.


## 0.22.0

### Added

- Global constraints via meta.
- Allow functional indexes.
- Expose further parameters for UniqueConstraints.
- `no_copy` attribute for fields.

### Changes

- Breaking: Factories pass now the kwargs as dict to get_pydantic_type, get_column_type, get_constraints.
  This allows now modifying the arguments passed down to the field.
- Breaking: init_fields_mapping doesn't initializes the field stats anymore.
- Breaking: model rebuilds are executed lazily when calling init_fields_mapping not when assigning fields manually anymore.

- Breaking: from_kwargs doesn't require model or table anymore. It is simply ignored.

### Fixed

- Q, and_, or_ support now complex kwargs like querysets.
- Failure querying when using proxy model table and kwargs.
- Proxy and main model use now the same tables.
  This could have been a problem when filtering against table columns of the proxy table in a query from the main table.

- Breaking: Alter tables_and_models to use the prefix as key with '' for the maintable and model.
- Breaking: Functions passed to filter functions reveive now a second positional parameter `tables_and_models`.
- `build_where_clause` conditionally uses a subquery.
- Rename QueryType to QuerySetType. The old name stays as an alias.

- `multi_related` is now a set containing tuples (from_fk, to_fk). This can be used to identify fields used by ManyToMany fields.
- Deprecate `is_multi`.
- Deprecate `parents`. There are no users, it was undocumented and uses are limited.

### Fixed

- Non-abstract through-models wouldn't be marked as many to many relations.
- Issues related with the Edgy shell initialization.

## 0.18.0

### Added

### Breaking changes (upgrade path)

``` python
set_tenant("foo")
```

Becomes now

``` python
with with_tenant("foo"):
  ...
```


``` python
activate_schema("foo")
...
deactivate_schema()
```

Becomes now

``` python
with with_schema("foo"):
  ...
```

## 0.17.4

### Fixed

- `model_dump_json` returns right result.
- `show_pk=False` can now be used to disable the inclusion of pk fields regardless of `__show_pk__`.

### Changed

- `crawl_relationship` has a slightly changed interface: it has `cross_db_remainder` as kwarg for callbacks and in the result.

### Key features

* **Model inheritance** - For those cases where you don't want to repeat yourself while maintaining
integrity of the models.
* **Abstract classes** - That's right! Sometimes you simply want a model that holds common fields
that doesn't need to created as a table in the database.
* **Meta classes** - If you are familiar with Django, this is not new to you and Edgy offers this
in the same fashion.
* **Managers** - Versatility at its core, you can have separate managers for your models to optimise
specific queries and querysets at ease.
* **Filters** - Filter by any field you want and need.
* **Model operators** - Classic operations such as `update`, `get`, `get_or_none`, `bulk_create`,
`bulk_update`, `values`, `values_list`, `only`, `defer` and a lot more.
* **Relationships made it easy** - Support for `OneToOne`, `ForeignKey` and `ManyToMany` in the same Django style.
* **Constraints** - Unique constraints through meta fields.
* **Indexes** - Unique indexes through meta fields.
* **Native test client** - We all know how hard it can be to setup that client for those tests you
need so we give you already one.
