# Release Notes

## 0.18.2

### Added

- New `SET_DEFAULT`, and `PROTECT` to `on_delete` in the ForeignKey.

### Removed

- `__db_model__` is removed. Replaced by registry = False.

### Changed

- Allow setting registry = False, for disabling retrieving the registry from parents.
- Removed unecessary warning for ManyToMany.
- Add warnings for problematic combinations in ForeignKey.
- Make QuerySet nearly keyword only and deprecate keywords not matching function names.
- Clone QuerySet via `__init__`.
- Make select_related variadic and deprecate former call taking a Sequence.
- Improved QuerySet caching.

## 0.18.1

### Changed

- Cleanup Model inheritance: Database related operations are put into a mixin. The customized metaclass is moved from EdgyBaseModel to `edgy.Model` as well as some db related ClassVars.
- `multi_related` is now a set containing tuples (from_fk, to_fk). This can be used to identify fields used by ManyToMany fields.
- Deprecate `is_multi`.
- Deprecate `parents`. There are no users, it was undocumented and uses are limited.

### Fixed

- Non-abstract through-models wouldn't be marked as many to many relations.
- Issues related with the Edgy shell initialization.

## 0.18.0

### Added

- ComputedField.
- Permission template.
- `reverse_clean` for ForeignKeys.
- Expanded filter methods of querysets (can pass now dict and querysets).
- Properly scoped `with_tenant` and `with_schema`.

### Changed

- Managers use now instance attributes (database, schema).
- Expose `as_select` instead of `raw_query`.
- `model_fields` contain now the fields so we can actually use the pydantic magic.
- BREAKING: deprecate `set_tenant` and remove manager hack. This way the tenant scope could leak. Use `with_tenant` instead.

### Fixed

- `select_related` works across ManyToMany fields.
- `select_related` couldn't handle multiple pathes to the same table.
- `select_related` would remove valid model instances because of non-existent related objects.
- Fix identifying clashing column names in joins, so every model gets its right parameters.
- Dependency tracking for join, so it doesn't depend on the order of `select_related`.
- `select_related` entries work in any order and don't overwrite each other.
-`only` and `defer` work on `select_related`.
- Autogenerated `id` wasn't added in model_dump.
- Tenants worked only till the first query.

### Breaking changes (upgrade path)

``` python
set_tenant("foo")
```

Becomes now

``` python
with with_tenant("foo"):
  ...
```


``` python
activate_schema("foo")
...
deactivate_schema()
```

Becomes now

``` python
with with_schema("foo"):
  ...
```

## 0.17.4

### Fixed

- `model_dump_json` returns right result.
- `show_pk=False` can now be used to disable the inclusion of pk fields regardless of `__show_pk__`.
- `__setattr__` is called after insert/update. We have transform_input already.

## 0.17.3

### Fixed

- Lazy ManyToMany fields.

## 0.17.2

### Added

- `build_where_clause` method in QuerySet for easing the integration in raw SQLAlchemy queries.

### Fixed

- `update` and `delete` methods of QuerySet did ignore or clauses.
- Fixed ManyToMany fields not able to use their owner Model as target.
- Fixed makemigration failing with foreignkeys when using model_apps.

## 0.17.1

### Added

- `CURRENT_MODEL_INSTANCE` ContextVariable which always point to a model instance.

### Fixed

- Under circumstances it was possible for the assigned database attribute to appear as value.
- Typings of some (class) properties are now correctly detected.
- FileFields doesn't need an explicit `to_file` call assignment anymore to work with revisions. This restriction was lifted.
- Execute database operation of `bulk_update` in right scope.

## 0.17.0

### Added

- Support for querying across multiple databases.
- Support for passing functions as clauses or keyword parameters.
- Support for autocreated reflection objects by pattern matching.
- Added some context variables for `extract_column_values` and `transform_input`:
  - `CURRENT_PHASE`: allows retrieving the current context in which it was executed.
  - `EXPLICIT_SPECIFIED_VALUES`: when set, it returns a set of the keys from the explicitly specified values.

### Changed

- `crawl_relationship` has a slightly changed interface: it has `cross_db_remainder` as kwarg for callbacks and in the result.
  Also it doesn't raise NotImplementedError anymore when detecting a crossdb situation.
- `is_cross_db` optionally gets a database as parameter and compares the databases instead of registries.
- Relax fields parameter requirements for values/values_list.
- More lazy meta/metadata.
- `database` attribute of models is used for queries instead of the main database of the registry.
- We use more metaclass kwarg arguments.
- Switch to python >= 3.9.
- Rename internal `_is_init` of MetaInfo to `_fields_are_initialized`.
- `phase` argument is shifted to `CURRENT_PHASE` context_var. If you rely on the correct phase you need to use it instead.
- `extract_column_values` provides now also a `CURRENT_PHASE` environment.
- `is_update` argument of `get_defaults` is now replaced by `CURRENT_PHASE` too. It is way more accurate.
- Deprecate `force_save` kwarg of save in favor of `force_insert`. This is way more precise.
- `post_save_callback` receives now also the `force_insert` parameter.

### Fixed

- `model_references` are superseeded by `post_save_fields` in meta.
- ModelParser mixin is gone. Use the classmethod `extract_column_values` instead.

- Remove superfluous BaseOneToOneKeyField. Merged into BaseForeignKeyField.
- Remove unused attributes of MetaInfo and added some lazy evaluations for fields.

## 0.8.1

### Added

- Added new experimental `activate_schema` for tenant models using the `using` queryset operator.

### Fixed

- Fixed metaclass for TenantMixin making sure all the queries are correctly pointing

### Key features

* **Model inheritance** - For those cases where you don't want to repeat yourself while maintaining
integrity of the models.
* **Abstract classes** - That's right! Sometimes you simply want a model that holds common fields
that doesn't need to created as a table in the database.
* **Meta classes** - If you are familiar with Django, this is not new to you and Edgy offers this
in the same fashion.
* **Managers** - Versatility at its core, you can have separate managers for your models to optimise
specific queries and querysets at ease.
* **Filters** - Filter by any field you want and need.
* **Model operators** - Classic operations such as `update`, `get`, `get_or_none`, `bulk_create`,
`bulk_update`, `values`, `values_list`, `only`, `defer` and a lot more.
* **Relationships made it easy** - Support for `OneToOne`, `ForeignKey` and `ManyToMany` in the same Django style.
* **Constraints** - Unique constraints through meta fields.
* **Indexes** - Unique indexes through meta fields.
* **Native test client** - We all know how hard it can be to setup that client for those tests you
need so we give you already one.
