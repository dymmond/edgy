# Managers

The managers are a great tool that **Edgy** offers. Heavily inspired by Django, the managers
allow you to build unique tailored queries ready to be used by your models.

**Edgy** by default uses the the manager called `query` which it makes it simple to understand.

Let us see an example.

```python hl_lines="23 25"
{!> ../docs_src/models/managers/simple.py !}
```

When querying the `User` table, the `query` (manager) is the default and **should** be always
presented when doing it so.

### Custom manager

It is also possible to have your own custom managers and to do it so, you **should inherit**
the **Manager** class and override the `get_queryset()`. For further customization it is possible to
use the **BaseManager** class.

For those familiar with Django managers, the concept is exactly the same. ðŸ˜€

**The managers must be type annotated ClassVar** or an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception will be raised.

```python hl_lines="19"
{!> ../docs_src/models/managers/example.py !}
```

Let us now create new manager and use it with our previous example.

```python hl_lines="26 42 45 48 55"
{!> ../docs_src/models/managers/custom.py !}
```

These managers can be as complex as you like with as many filters as you desire. What you need is
simply override the `get_queryset()` and add it to your models.

### Override the default manager

Overriding the default manager is also possible by creating the custom manager and overriding
the `query` manager. By default the `query`is also used for related queries. This can be customized via setting
an explicit `query_related` manager.

```python hl_lines="26 39 42 45 48"
{!> ../docs_src/models/managers/override.py !}
```

Now with only overwriting the related manager:

```python hl_lines="26 39 42 45 48"
{!> ../docs_src/models/managers/override_related.py !}

!!! Warning
    Be careful when overriding the default manager as you might not get all the results from the
    `.all()` if you don't filter properly.
