# Automatic Reflection

Let's reflect reflection:

we can reflect tables from database in a model. The next step is to retrieve the tables
and create reflection models from it.

For doing so we have selections via Pattern Models:

They contain a Meta with the regex attribute and generate via the template string or function a new ReflectionModel:


```python
from edgy.contrib.autoreflection import AutoReflectModel

class Reflected(AutoReflectModel):
    class Meta:
        include_pattern = ".*"  # regex or string, default .*. Matches against the tablename
        exclude_pattern = None  # regex or string, default None (disabled). Matches against the tablename
        template = "{modelname}{tablename}"  # string or function with arguments tablename, modelname, tablekey
        databases = (None,)  # Restrict reflection to databases. None: main database of registry, string extra databases of registry
```

Note: when a reflected model is generated the meta is switched in the copy to a regular MetaInfo.

## Meta parameters

Note: we use the table name not the table key.

What is the difference:

table name: `tablename`
table key: `schema.tablename`

That is because edgy handle schemes a little bit different:

In edgy a model can exist in multiple schemes and the scheme is explicit selected.

### Inclusion & Exclusion patterns

Here we can specify patterns against which a regex is checked. By default the `include_pattern` is set to
`.*` which matches all tablenames and the `exclude_pattern` is disabled.

The `include_pattern` will convert all falsy values to the match all, while the exclude_pattern will be really disabled.

### Template

Can be a function which takes the tablename as parameter and is required to return a string.

Or it can be a format string with the possible parameters:

- tablename: the name of the table
- tablekey: the key (name with scheme) of the table
- modelname: the model name

### Databases

In the registry you specify a main database (which is here None) and via the extra dictionary multiple named databases.
The extra databases can be selected via their name while the main can be selected by `None`.

This controls from which database the models are reflected. This is useful to extract data from other databases and to use it in the main application.

By default the autoreflection only uses the main databases.
